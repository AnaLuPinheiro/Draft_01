Our main findings are aligned with existing empirical data and our initial hypothesis. As expected, we see that average schools' ENEM scores are significantly explained by the type of school, the family's average income, the parents' professional status, and the parents' educational level.


This association, suggested by our initial analysis and box-plot graph, was validated in our statistical testing by both ANOVA and regression methods. Results show that Private schools have significantly higher scores on average than Public Schools. This is expected, since the students from Private schools tend to come from privileged families, while Public school students often come from more vulnerable family backgrounds.
